## BUILT WITH

  FLUTTER <br \>
  DART <br \>
  GOLANG <br \>

## Getting Started

In this project, I tried to develop a solution to facilitate inventory management. Currently, goods can only be added to the stock in meters, but I plan to create a more functional solution in the future. Additionally, the application has a multilingual support infrastructure, currently supporting English and Turkish.

## Anasayfa

After login, this screen greets us. On this screen, there is the profit and loss calculation for the current month and a graph of profit and sales for all months of the year

## Satışlar

On this screen, we record our sales. To make a sale, the item must be in stock beforehand; otherwise, the sale will fail and will not be added to the records. The quantity of the sold item is deducted from the stock.

Sales of the current month are listed. If you want to view past records, you should enter 'Old records' from the top right.

## Tedarikciler

On this screen, we add the individuals or companies from whom we purchase materials. We select the currency we work with for the supplier and save it.

## Ürünler

Here, we can view the products we have purchased. Additionally, you can add products from this screen as well. If the products you add have the same name, they will be grouped under that name; if their colors are the same, their meters will be added under the same color. The products we have sold are also removed from here.
